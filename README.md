1.	INTRODUCTION
1.1AUGMENTED REALITY
A technology that superimposes a computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world, thus providing a composite view.AR can be defined as a system that fulfills three basic features: a combination of real and virtual worlds, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects.

1.2SPATIAL ANALYSIS
Spatial analysis describes methods to study the location, distribution, and relationship of spatial phenomena. Spatial analysis allows you to solve complex location-oriented problems and better understand where and what is occurring in your world. It goes beyond mere mapping to let you study the characteristics of places and the relationships between them. Spatial analysis lends new perspectives to your decision-making.

1.3SPATIAL ANALYSIS USING AUGMENTED REALITY
Using PlaceIt the users can virtually experience the product before physically seeing  the product . A object virtually transported  to the location of the user’s choice. The user can then select the object according to its adequate requirements. So with PlaceIt,we are hoping to provide a solution where a user has no need to move from his physical location to analyze the required space. 
2.SOFTWARES USED WITH API AND DESCRIPTION
(A) Google’s Firebase Realtime Database:
Firebase is a mobile and web app development platform that provides developers with a plethora of tools and services to help them develop high-quality apps, grow their user base, and earn more profit. I t has provided us with backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users. The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud- hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in real-time to every connected client. When we build cross-platform apps with our iOS, Android, and JavaScript SDKs, all of your clients share one Realtime Database instance and automatically receive updates with the newest data. We used the real time database to display the live counter for the number of people in the area where our model is installed.
(B) Android Studio
Android Studio is the official integrated development environment for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development. We used android studio to create two of our modules (Security and Common User).
(C) ARCORE
AR Core, also known as Google Play Services for AR, is a software development kit developed by Google that allows for augmented reality applications to be built. AR Core uses three key technologies to integrate virtual content with the real world as seen through your phone's camera Six degrees of freedom allows the phone to understand and track its position relative to the world. Environmental understanding allows the phone to detect the size and location of flat horizontal surfaces like the ground or a coffee table. Light estimation allows the phone to estimate the environment's current lighting conditions. AR Core has been integrated into a multitude of devices.
